I analyzed how elevation affects the probablility of a hit being a homerun in the MLB. I simulated many random "hits" with different exit velocities and launch angles and then changed the drag in the equations of motion to see how far the balls would go. This involves the concepts of drag and air density. I used Python and Mathematica.
